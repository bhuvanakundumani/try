		<h3><p>If Einstein were to conduct learning programs for children today…
		what would he have them explore?</p></br>
		<p>	Given his love for science, his disparagement of the rote learning system
		and his strong belief in the power of imagination,
		he would have children going beyond knowledge...
		to explore...
		 </p>
		<p>At ThinkDiff Skool, we  believe that Imagination is powerful.</p>
		
		<p>We believe that in today’s educational environment there is a growing need to rekindle the intuitive mind in children… a strong need to reinstate in them the fun of creation and bring out in them, their  innate ability to design... </p>
		
		<p>ThinkDiff Skool is an initiative to provide opportunities for young minds to explore new advances in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) in a positive environment that encourages them to see more… know more… question more… We provide programs that awaken children from the stupor that rote learning brings and give them a  leg up on to a platform that allows them the space to explore their imagination and give shape to their ideas.</p> </h3>
