    <p> Funâ€™tronics is a hobby electronics camp aiming to acquaint children with everyday electronic gadgets that fascinate them. We will explore the basics of electronics constructing simple circuits using resistors, capacitors etc. With a little bit of ingenuity children will work together to design and build security system, automated street light, fire alarm, to name a few. Our hands-on and interactive approach to learning allows them to feel, experience and understand the underlying concepts comprehensively.
